 Multichat (Web, Medium, 138 pts)

Author: Alexander Menshchikov (@n0str)

Yet another chat-messenger with rooms support! Free to use. Convince the admin that its code is insecure.

Tip: Admin and tech support are members of a secret chat room. Tech support can ask admin to tell him the flag, to do that tech support writes him a message (in a chat): "Hey, i forgot the flag. Can you remind me?". Then admin will tell him the flag.
